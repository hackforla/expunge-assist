 - Who she is and what her job is
 - Where would you go and who would you want for me?
 - What is the reason why people don't show up at the clinic?
 - Does she have a follow-up process for when people don't show up?- Tell me a story about the last time you when into a clinic?    
 - When it couldn't get someone to a clinic?    
 -  When it did work? 
 - How many different kinds of services do you inform them of?How does she do "out-reach"?
 - Did you know that a person can just make an appointment with a public defender?
 - Why is it that they have to hear it from someone else that exponent works?
 - What kind of support do they need to get on the expungement path?
 - How many people does she talk to in a day?
 
 We would like to move to a working hypothesis of the issue around why more people don't apply for expungement. In a brainstorm we came up with a few reasons:
 - Cost
 - No Trust in the system
 - Usefulness (Effort not worth return)
 - Transportation
 - Time
 
 ### General Questions
 - How many people fill out the fee waiver for expungement?   
 - How do you increase trust with people with records?   
 - What would it take for you to trust the expungement process?   
 - We should talk to Ingrid about how background checks affect people's employment?

 Bo is convinced that geophagy matters - Include a map in our final version of this project?
 
 Questions for Bo
 - Bo uses Google forms
 - Personal ID Info might be there, so we might not be able to see it all but we can see some?   
 - What time of convictions   
 - What's Bo's no-show-rate? (Ask Bo)
- How many clients/cases does an attorney see at a clinic?
