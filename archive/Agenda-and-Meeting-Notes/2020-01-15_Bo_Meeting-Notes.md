# Meeting Notes 
From Meeting with Bonita Money on 1/15/2020 at Noon
Present: Bo, Nina, Fred, Tray, Tina, Angela & 2 other staff members

## Topics & Questions
### Purpose
1. See where we could help
2. See what we can learn
3. Get contacts to interview

Expanded Purpose: 
- The original purpose of the meeting was to see how we can provide auxiliary support to NDICA apart from the project.
- Bo's expanded services
- Gun charges that are non-violent
- indicated that she has been working with other states/cities to set up expungement clinics all over the US. Including: 
    - Michigan, Ohio, & Florida
    - Locally, Fresno, CA

      Facts about the Michigan expungement process 
      - 50$ for filing  Chicago 
      - they paid for fee waivers 
      - She does outreach and they reach out to her

      Facts about the expungement process in the State of Illinois
      - “Automatic” still takes 12-18 months 
      - 300% under Fed rate of poverty to get fee waivers

      Facts about the expungement process in Mississippi 
      - You have to file with 5 agencies, and each filing cost 6K 
      - in addition to lawyer fees (about 2K)

 ### Gun Charges (New)
      - Gun Charges take longer because:
          - Requires a judge meeting  
          - Explain "Why they need Expongment" (in affidavit)        
            - Effecting 
            - my housing       
            -  Student load/Fin Aid 
      - Longer time frame because they have to set an appointment with a judge
  In LA, the Process can take 6 weeks or more
        - So if housing or a job comes up 
        - you will lose that place/position 


## Barriers
### Money
90% of the time they don’t file because of money
- "They can fill out all the paperwork for a person, but when they check in on them they find they have not sent them out because they can't afford the filing fees." 
- Even if an applicant has money, they still file the fee waivers  
- because Judges don't even bother to look too closely at paperwork, so fee waivers can slip in.


### Key Insights
HOW MANY ARE ELIGIBLE?
 - 200K people who qualify for Prop 64 (CfA intends on clearing all of those... maybe by 2021 deadline?)
 - 1MM people who qualify for prop 47
    - Would it be helpful for us to build an engine for producing a personal statement

Bo - Criminal Court & other org's
- "Criminal Defenders HAVE to do these clinics"
- you can walk in and get expungement, but no one does because they are afraid of people and org's associated with the police.
- Some Law Firms require that their lawyers donate "x-amount" of their time to a non-profit.
- one such org is Latham & Watkins (that company donates over a million hours a year)

"Fred said" - He would go to small businesses (restaurants and barbershops) and get them to post about NDICA's expungement to get the word out
“When you get to my age, you found a way to live without [expungement]”

SB 94 bill - Senator Supported expungement class
- Lowest turnout ever
- it was near a sub-station, so no one felt safe to go

### Questions
- Can we get access to some of your survey data
- Can you add to your survey, "how did you hear about us?"


 ### Action Items
For Bo
- Testimonials Video
- SEO   
- Press Page & links

For us
Look into making a "personal statement generator" for affidavit's
like - https://www.lawdepot.com/contracts/affidavit-form/preview.aspx?loc=USCA&

### Outreach Objective - 
Criminal Court - start outreach there

Dispensaries 
-  Only 3 legal dispensaries operate out of her area
- They can not reward people for refering people to clinics
