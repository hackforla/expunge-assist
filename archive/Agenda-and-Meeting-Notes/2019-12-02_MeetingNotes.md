## Conversations & Meeting topics 
Mike Walked us through a proposal to approach the problem of a supply of lawyers 
-  Approach law students to do their pro bono hours with our demographic

Example of Howard Law School
 - People would call into Howard Law school to see if their case
   - how do you filter out who has a valid case in this hotline method?
   - If they had the documentation they would email it to the Law school with follow up calls
- Law Student, would present the issue to their Advisor 
- The advisor would make the judgment call on whether to take the case or not. 
      - what are the factors that determine case acceptance?
        - Time
           - preferably under 6 months to a year case should/can be taken on by a student
        - Complexity
           - Factors that determine timelines for cases 
             - Mental health, State Vs Fed Charges, clients demeanor toward authority
- Since most marijuana convictions do not need extensive legal research or to go to trial, these should be easy & fast work for a new lawyer.
