## Next Steps for the group
A. Find out who our target group of users is

B. Read through the research in Google Drive

      1. Write a list of any noteworthy research points that strikes you while reading through the Google Drive docs, websites, etc. i.e. Facts, interview quotes, 
          like the ‘3% who get their record expunged’ fact that Wes cited. 
          And Mike’s list from last night- all important. Note everything that seems like an important insight to you.
          
      2. When you’ve finished your list, transfer each note down onto a post-it note. One research point per post-it.
      
      3. Come together with all of the post-its to [affinity map](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/affinity-diagram/) everyone’s insights and see what comes up!

C. Begin User Research:

      1. Identify Specific contacts at [orginizations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ni36My_2SupdYKTWryrQK-hOANdM3RaDf-rBQGYfYe0/edit) to set interviews 
      
      2. Create survey for users use [this as a baseline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13wu4xlUr_qlMz5wSLa4MJeKohLiWkva15TvXomXs628/edit) to have answered by potential users       
      3. Start Aggrogating the data to find common issues and problems
