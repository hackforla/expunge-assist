### Notes from the Remote working Presentation by Bonnie
- Bonnies projects meet twice a week, and often have remote only members
- with the spike in health risks, Bonnie walked us through remote working tools and a remote onboarding plan
- Free Meeting tools, such as Zoom & Google Hangouts are great
  - Zoom is free for up to 45min meetings but can be rejoined after 45 min
  - Hangouts can get "laggy" after about 5 people join the call  
- Remote onboarding plans were also discussed to prevent Community Spread illness
   - It was concluded that we should have short intro videos on the Hack for LA website
