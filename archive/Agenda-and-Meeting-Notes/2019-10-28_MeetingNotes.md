# Record Clearance Project Meeting Notes

Date: Oct 28, 2019 - 6:25pm

Who was in attendance: Charlotte, Perry, & Angela


### Tasks: 
We kicked off yesterday's meeting with 2 questions, listed below in bold. Then we began to ideate around what section of the user journey our solution will address. Lastly, we ended with Action items per person and what to ask for during onboarding next week. 

Blocker: The biggest blocker for us was a lack of information around a few things, one what is the cohort of people that Code For America is targeting with automated clearance? What should be our cohort? Should we take up ClearMyRecord.org? A general lack of understanding around the user personas and landscape slowed progress. 

Moving forward, it would be helpful if everyone read up on these documents before next Monday:

          E. [AB-1793 Cannabis convictions bill](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB1793)

## What we covered:
### Sprint Style Start Questions (1 hour)
#### 1. Why are we doing this?
   - Final Ideal/Vision - To Help people understand and exercise their rights to clear their record(s) of marijuana-related charges as of the passage of California Bill AB -1793.
                 
#### 2. Where do we want to be in 6months/1year/5yrs?
 
  Ideas around what our project goal should be:
  - Every single court system has our product on their website as a resource. 
  - Count of people who successfully cleared their record using our product
  - Engagement of general public 
  - Large Awareness around record clearance for marijuana-related charges

#### - Final Ideal/Vision: 
 Increase record clearance to 5% in 6 months, 7% by one year, and 45% in 5 Years. Context, only 3% of eligible people have cleared their record in the year since the passing of California Bill AB -1793. This bill could impact 22,000 people in California.

## Ideation 
What areas of the user Journey we should focus on:
    A. How does this affect your life and career? 
       - No, I wouldn't want to focus on the life you can't have, or can't do. It's too negative.
    B. Should we focus on the first steps? Helping motivate and facilitate the journey at the beginning? 
       - Yes, the current website is not active and missing info. User Journey to get to record clearance is long, and we will operate at the beginning of the funnel/process.
