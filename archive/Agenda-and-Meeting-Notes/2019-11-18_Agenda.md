Next Week 11/25/2019
- [Affinity Workshop](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/affinity-diagram/) 
  - Moving our affinity Workshop to next week to avoid confusion on on-boarding night
  - 1. Write a list of any noteworthy research points 
    - From the Google Drive docs, websites, etc. i.e. Facts, interview quotes, that strikes you while reading
    - like the ‘3% who get their record expunged’ fact that Wes cited. 
    - And Mike’s list from last night- all important. Note everything that seems like an important insight to you.
  - 2. When you’ve finished your list, transfer each note down onto a post-it note. One research point per post-it.
  - 3. Come together with all of the post-its to affinity map everyone’s insights and see what comes up!
