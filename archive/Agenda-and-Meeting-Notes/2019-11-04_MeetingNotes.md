# Record Clearance Project Meeting Notes

Date: Nov 4, 2019 - 7:08pm
Who was in attendance: Charlotte, Mike, Alyssa, Kelsey, Tina, Perry, & Angela

## Project Scope Question
Previously we thought the law limited eligibility to just Marijuana-related convictions, but after further analysis, we discovered there were some offenses that were reclassified and we wanted to look into including those as a part of this project. Some potential factors that could sway our project are:

### Scaleability 
- Could this project template expand to a National instead of just Los Angeles or California?

### Redundancy 
- will this project become obsolete with the CFA Automation project?
- if automation comes into play how long will the automation project take? Days/Weeks/Years?
When it comes into play who can it help? 
- Only new offenses or will it be retro-active

### Impact 
- if we broaden scope do we have the potential to help more people?



## Perry's Look at online landscape
Last week we asked Perry to look into what other services occupy the digital space for record clearance and expungement, here is what he found.

# Scope
### Prop 47 is the scope -  
Centering our focus on marijuana & other minor non-violent crimes eligible after the passing of Prop 47. We would have to look into which other convictions can be considered for expungement. 

### Documenting Decision
- Decision tree for the project
   - Decision tree will document all of the decisions we made along the way
   - With the goal of scaling to other places (counties maybe even other states)

Questions for Adici, 
 - Are there any updates on personas/user journey?
 - how long will it take to get automation up and running? 
 - What is a given person's time frame for how long it takes?
 - How are people notified if they are eligible for clearance?
 - Is it retroactive?

# Tasks for next week
### How can we split up this research:
 - Previous campaigns, why did they fail? Alyssa
 - What is the list of crimes, quantify? - Mike    
 - Excel sheet with redacted info - Mike
 - Set up Git with hub of info - Angela
