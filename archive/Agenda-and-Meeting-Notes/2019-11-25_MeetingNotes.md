## Conversations & Meeting topics 
There were a series of questions that were rased around the direction of research such as:
1. Different levels of record clearance
 - Dismissal ?
 - Completly removed?
 - Is there but blacked out?
 - It would be great to know who can see what on a back ground check?
2. What would Client Service Doc look like for us? 
 - Flow Chart
3. Should we try partnering with NDICA around a backend service or addtional help?
 - Maile brought up that another group had approached NDICA about help and Bo, was annoyed that two different groups had approached her and not united beforehand. 
 - If we did, it would take a lot of trust-building & time. 
4. What are the specifics of each prop?
 - Paragraph on what those are
 - What crimes do those prop's cover
 - What is AB 1076 - and all the parameters 
5. Trust is a big issue with this population
 - Ask them who they would trust, Who is a legitimate source of info?
6. What are local orginizations that could help connect us to people with records?
- Is there a community or church clinic
 
These questions lead to consolidated buckets
