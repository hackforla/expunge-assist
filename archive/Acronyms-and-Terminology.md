# Acronyms and Terminology

(Whenever you’re confused by something as you get to know the project space, please add to this section!)

- “PD” in our context usually means Public Defender, not police department. For example, it’s confusing to hear “LAPD” helping with expungement. This is extremely important when communicating with justice-impacted individuals, as “PD” has very negative connotations.


    - Always use “Pub Def” to abbreviate, rather than PD. 
- “NDICA” - [National Diversity and Inclusion Cannabis Alliance](http://thendica.org/)


- CFA = Code for America
- KYR = Know Your Right- Name of Slack channel on CFA
