        tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance
        Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security
        Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be
        subjected to such laws, you may not use this application. You may not
        use the Application in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
        Act (GLBA)
