      <h3>Why do I need a personal statement?</h3>
      <p>
        The personal statement is a brief essay about your current life
        situation. You can use it to tell the judge why you’re worthy of having
        your felony conviction re-classified as a misdemeanor under Prop 47. You
        can also use it for the same purpose to reclassify your marijuana felony
        conviction to a misdemeanor or have it completely expunged under Pro 64.
