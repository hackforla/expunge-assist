    "section7Dropdown1Title": "Why do I need a declaration letter?",
    "section7Dropdown1Paragraph": "When you file a petition with the court, you have the opportunity to attach a personal letter called a “declaration letter” explaining why you deserve a fresh start.\n\nThe declaration letter is your opportunity to explain to a judge why you want your criminal record cleared or your charges reduced. A declaration letter can help your case by adding your personal reasons and motivation to your legal case.\n",
    "section7Dropdown2Title": "Why does expungement or reclassification matter to me?",
    "section7Dropdown2Paragraph": "The word “expungement” can be confusing. Expungement means that in most cases your past criminal record cannot be used against you when applying for a job, housing or student loans. You also regain some of your rights like serving on a jury or owning a gun.\n\nEven though your criminal record does not disappear from the public record forever, your record will be updated to show that the conviction has been dismissed.\n\nReclassification allows you to change past felony convictions to a misdemeanor, even if you have served a sentence and parole. Once the felony has been removed from your criminal record, you may be eligible for benefits not previously available to you.\n",
    "section7Dropdown3Title": "Can law enforcement get a search warrant to access my data on this site?",
    "section7Dropdown3Paragraph": "No. Even if law enforcement were to search this site for your data, there would be no data to find. We do not store or save any of your data, ever.

    "section1": "Expungement Basics",
    "title1.1": "What is expungement?",
    "paragraph1.1a": "Expungement of a past criminal conviction in California means that the conviction is dismissed. It is also called “record clearance,” “dismissal,” or “record relief.”",
    "paragraph1.1b": "If your conviction is eligible for dismissal but is not eligible for automatic dismissal, you can apply to, or “petition”, the court for it to be dismissed.",
    "paragraph1.1c": "Expungement lifts many of the negative effects of a criminal conviction and can give you a fresh start in your life.",
    "title1.2": "What is a declaration letter?",
    "paragraph1.2a": "A declaration letter in California is a written statement in a petition for expungement or reduction of some infractions, misdemeanors, or felonies. It may be required or may be added as supporting evidence depending on your case.",
    "paragraph1.2b": "It is a written letter that explains why dismissal of your conviction would be in the interest of justice. It allows you to tell the judge your story and describe your circumstances, efforts to reform, and motivation for expungement or reduction. It is often about one page long.",
    "title1.3": "Why does reduction or expungement matter to me?",
    "paragraph1.3a": "Expungement means that in most cases your past criminal conviction cannot be used against you when applying for a job, housing, state licensing, or student loans. You may also regain some of your rights, like, in some cases, owning a firearm.",
    "paragraph1.3b": "Reduction, also called “reclassification” or “redesignation”, allows you to change a past felony conviction to a misdemeanor, or a misdemeanor to an infraction, even if you have served a sentence. Certain legal provisions allow a felony conviction to be reduced to a misdemeanor and then be expunged.",
    "title1.4": "What is the expungement process in California?",

    "title2.3": "My conviction was not in California. Can I still use Expunge Assist?",
    "paragraph2.3a": "This tool is currently intended only for people with criminal convictions in California. Each state has different rules on record clearance, so you should check the laws of the state in which you have your conviction.",
    "paragraph2.3b": "However, if your state requires or allows for a written declaration letter to clear your record, then you may want to take a look at the Expunge Assist declaration letter generator as a guide for the writing process or to help get a better idea of what a declaration letter may contain.",
    "title2.4": "I see incorrect information on this website. What should I do?",
    "paragraph2.4a": "<p>Get in touch at <a href='mailto:info@expungeassist.org' rel='noreferrer'>info@expungeassist.org.</a> The laws change often in California, and that could mean some information is outdated in this website.

    "paragraph3.1b": "The deadline to apply was November 22, 2022. However, you may still apply if you can show the court that you had a good reason to miss the deadline.",
    "paragraph3.1c": "If the court finds that you had a good reason and that your conviction is eligible, it will reduce your conviction to a misdemeanor. In certain cases, your conviction can be dismissed.",

    "title3.2": "Do I need to submit a declaration letter under Proposition 47?",
    "paragraph3.2a": "Depending on your situation, for example, if you did not satisfy the terms of your probation, or if you had a jail or prison sentence, you may include or attach a declaration letter or supporting documents that your petition is in the interests of justice.",
    "paragraph3.2b": "In this case, a declaration letter, though not required, can help strengthen your case and convince the court.",

    "title3.3": "How does Proposition 64 help me?",
    "paragraph3.3a": "California changed the law for marijuana offenses in 2016, and Proposition 64 changed many marijuana convictions to misdemeanors. These include the sale of marijuana and the possession of marijuana for sale or cultivation.",
    "paragraph3.3b": "If you have a conviction from before November 9, 2016, it may be eligible for automatic redesignation to a misdemeanor or even dismissal and sealing. In most cases you do not need to file a petition. If your marijuana conviction has not been cleaned up, you can apply/petition with the court but do not need to submit a declaration letter.",

    "title3.4": "How is Proposition 47 different from Proposition 64?",
    "paragraph3.4a": "<p>Proposition 47 reduces certain eligible drug or theft felonies to misdemeanors. The deadline for applying for reduction was November 22, 2022, but if the court finds that you have a good reason to miss the deadline, <b>you may still be eligible. Depending on your case, you may want to include a declaration letter in your petition.</b></p>",
    "paragraph3.4b": "<p>Proposition 64 automatically cleans up marijuana-related convictions, either with redesignation to a misdemeanor, or dismissal and sealing. Most eligible cases are reduced or dismissed automatically by the courts. If your conviction has not been cleaned up, you may apply but <b>do not need to submit a declaration letter.</b> There is no time limit for applying for redesignation or dismissal of a conviction.</p>",
    "title3.5": "How does Senate Bill 731 help me?",
    "paragraph3.5a": "<p>Senate Bill 731 is a law, effective July 1, 2023, that extends automatic conviction expungement from only convictions with probation sentences, where probation was not violated, to other felony convictions if 4 years have passed and you have not been convicted of a new felony offense. If you are eligible for automatic expungement under this law, you <b>do not need to petition or write a declaration letter.</b></p>"
