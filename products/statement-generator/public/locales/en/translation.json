    "section7Dropdown1Paragraph": "When you file a petition with the court, you have the opportunity to attach a personal letter called a “declaration” explaining why you deserve a fresh start.\n\nThe declaration letter is your opportunity to explain to a judge why you want your criminal record cleared or your charges reduced. A declaration can help your case by adding your personal reasons and motivation to your legal case.\n",
    "section7Dropdown2Title": "Why does expungement or reclassification matter to me?",
    "section7Dropdown2Paragraph": "The word “expungement” can be confusing. Expungement means that in most cases your past criminal record cannot be used against you when applying for a job, housing or student loans. You also regain some of your rights like serving on a jury or owning a gun.\n\nEven though your criminal record does not disappear from the public record forever, your record will be updated to show that the conviction has been dismissed.\n\nReclassification allows you to change past felony convictions to a misdemeanor, even if you have served a sentence and parole. Once the felony has been removed from your criminal record, you may be eligible for benefits not previously available to you.\n",
    "section7Dropdown3Title": "Can law enforcement get a search warrant to access my data on this site?",
    "section7Dropdown3Paragraph": "No. Even if law enforcement were to search this site for your data, there would be no data to find. We do not store or save any of your data, ever.

    "section1": "Expungement Basics",
    "title1.1": "What is expungement?",
    "paragraph1.1a": "Expungement of a past criminal conviction in California means that the conviction is dismissed. It is also called “record clearance,” “dismissal,” or “record relief.”<br><br>",
    "paragraph1.1b": "If your conviction is eligible for dismissal but is not eligible for automatic dismissal, you can apply to, or “petition”, the court for it to be dismissed.<br><br>",
    "paragraph1.1c": "Expungement lifts many of the negative effects of a criminal conviction and can give you a fresh start in your life.",
    "title1.2": "What is a declaration?",

    "paragraph1.2b": "It is a written letter that explains why dismissal of your conviction would be in the interest of justice. It allows you to tell the judge your story and describe your circumstances, efforts to reform, and motivation for expungement or reduction. It is often about one page long.",
    "title1.3": "Why does reduction or expungement matter to me?",
    "paragraph1.3a": "Expungement means that in most cases your past criminal conviction cannot be used against you when applying for a job, housing, state licensing, or student loans. You may also regain some of your rights, like, in some cases, owning a firearm.<br><br>",
    "paragraph1.3b": "Reduction, also called “reclassification” or “redesignation”, allows you to change a past felony conviction to a misdemeanor, or a misdemeanor to an infraction, even if you have served a sentence.
