        To Whom It May Concern, Thank you so much for taking the time to read my
        personal statement. My name is Jenna Smith, and I am 27 years old.
        Recently, I have been working as a security guard for United Federal
        Credit Union. I have also been attending my local AA meetings regularly.
        Since my last conviction, my life has changed for the better. I am
        focussing on my sobriety, and being a better parent and partner. I want
        to make my daughter proud. I have been really involved in community
        service. In particular, I’ve been working with Pauly’s Project. I lead
        the outreach team, and distribute food to unhoused neighbors throughout
        the LA area. Also I have been participating in LA Youth Soccer. I mentor
        young soccer players and provide valuable coaching. I am working towards
        going back to school, so that I can become a social worker. I have been
        taking night classes at Rosedale Community Center, and I have been
        shadowing a social worker on Fridays. I want to clear my record because
        I am a different person from who I was when I was convicted. I want to
        make the world a better place. Clearing my record will help me gain
        access to better opportunities and set an example for my daughter.
        Sincerely, Jenna Smith
