### Project Resources

Read through and bookmark the following:

**Your workspaces:**
EA uses GitHub, Slack, Google Drive, and Figma. We don't use Miro, Notion, or other tools. Please use these shared drives / boards and not your personal drive or board, so that all work is saved for future EA volunteers! 
- [ ] [Github project board](https://github.com/orgs/hackforla/projects/77/views/1)
- [ ] [Google Drive UXR folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/19_poQEFMDggXKmbfkEqF8FwLuCu8d-Qn)
- [ ] [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/hYqRxmBVtJbDv9DJXV6nra/Expunge-Assist-Main-Figma?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)
- [ ] [UXR Figjam board](<https://www.figma.com/board/DQcMAN49OUsCieINIZbAh0/UXR-FigJam-board---Expunge-Assist?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=Ulzw4Z5xqoXcbvOv-0>) This is not in regular use, but is a space we can use. There are also existing FigJam boards for PMs and Content / Design collab.

**Specific Figma pages**
UXR may use Figma to give feedback on WIP by the Content + Design teams, so the following will help you familiarize yourself with those spaces.
- [ ] Read ["Start Here"](https://www.figma.com/file/hYqRxmBVtJbDv9DJXV6nra/Expunge-Assist-Main-Figma?type=design&node-id=2%3A21&mode=design&t=g8j5PA8CesPhD7N5-1) page on Figma. Read the Team Workflow "Practical steps to getting the work done" on the Start Here page. This is a general guide to how we collaborate between cross-functional teams and take an issue through to completion.
- [ ] Familiarize with Figma - [master pages](https://www.figma.com/file/hYqRxmBVtJbDv9DJXV6nra/Expunge-Assist-Main-Figma?type=design&node-id=2-37&mode=design) "desktop" and "mobile" we are working in responsive web, no app. These are the source of truth sections.
- [ ] Familiarize with [Work in Progress](https://www.figma.com/file/hYqRxmBVtJbDv9DJXV6nra/Expunge-Assist-Main-Figma?type=design&node-id=2349-24717&mode=design) pages. This is where we work and collaborate between Design and Content.
- [ ] Familiarize with the [Design hand off space to Dev](https://www.figma.com/file/hYqRxmBVtJbDv9DJXV6nra/Expunge-Assist-Main-Figma?type=design&node-id=2-38&mode=design), this happens at the end of an issue
- [ ] There is a [Figma Archive](https://www.figma.com/file/jaYLRw4dCTYhGYOI9aMehr/Expunge-Assist---Figma-Archive?type=design&node-id=4875-45387&mode=design) with work prior to 2024. This is because the free version ran out of storage space. This is a resource to see previous design decisions.

## Your first issue

Now that you are familiar with our project and learned a bit about using our tools, it's time to work on your first issue. It's important to practice the following:

- Most of our issues are 1pt (1pt should = 1 week of work, 6 hours or less), but do occasionally get higher than that. Start small and work your way up. We discuss upcoming issues during UXR meetings, you can express interest for any issue during the meetings
- Frequently add updates to all issues you are assigned to or providing input to
  - Updates are required once a week and should use the following format:

```
1. Progress
2. Blockers
3. Availability
4. ETA
```

- Make sure to check off 'Action Items' as they are completed
- Make sure to close issues as you finish them
